                    <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dogs have a sense of time but Don't undersand the concept of time. Unlike humansa, dogs don't have the ability to create measure of time. Like seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.They also don't know how to read clocks so you have to do it! So if you tell them "I will be back in 15 minutes" It won't do much, but over time, they will gradually have an idea on what 15 minutes is.

                        Of the many remarkable traits dogs possess, their sense of smell is arguably their most superpower-like ability. While
                        humans have about six million olfactory receptors, breeds like the Bloodhound have up to 300 million, allowing them to
                        detect scents at concentrations nearly 100 million times lower than we can. This incredible nose is not just for
                        tracking; a dog's brain dedicates 40 times more space to analyzing smells than a human brain does. They can sniff out
                        diseases like cancer and diabetes in human breath, detect underground pests, and even find ancient fossils buried deep
                        beneath the earth. Every walk is a complex narrative of scent, telling them a detailed story of who has passed by, their
                        health, and even their emotional state.
